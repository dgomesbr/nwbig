The Avenger II GMT stands out with its very practical 24-hour second time-zone display, complemented by a bidirectional rotating bezel enabling a third time-zone reading. The officially chronometer-certified self-winding caliber is protected by an ultra-sturdy steel case water-resistant to 300 m (1,000 ft) and equipped with lateral reinforcements. The efficiency of the controls is guaranteed by a solid crown with a non-slip grip. The aviation-inspired stencil-type numerals lend a technical and original touch of style.
