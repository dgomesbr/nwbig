# Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore Diver 15703

This Offshore Diver was introduced in 2010 during the SIHH in Geneva.
Like all other Offshore models, the 15703ST has these typical rubber accents, like the crowns and the thick rubber gasket between the Royal Oak case and the octagonal bezel. Additionally, this Offshore Diver comes with a rubber strap only. AP mastered to get a rubber strap that feels comfortable enough without being too soft. The rubber accents fit the black ‘méga tapisserie‘ dial perfectly and luckily AP didn’t choose to use bright colors this time to spice things up. It is a plain black diver’s watch that could be interpreted as an understatement time piece by AP.

One of the first things that noticed about this watch is the comfort of wearing it despite the dimensions of 42mm x 13.75mm.
The Offshore Diver 15703ST has an extra crown at 10 o’clock. With this extra crown, you can operate the inner (diving) bezel of the watch. The dial is very readable, luminova has been applied to the hour markers and on the baton hands. Furthermore, the dial gives only the information needed: brand name, automatic movement and the level of water resistance.

The automatic movement is AP’s in-house cal.3210 with a power reserve of 60 hours and a very impressive finish. The 22ct gold rotor has been engraved with monograms, the bridge and other middle parts are decorated by Côtes de Geneve and the base plate has been finished with a technique call stippling.
Although caliber 3120 is a very pretty movement to look at, AP chose to close the hatch by a stainless steel case back instead of a display back.
