!!! Info
    This version is currently discontinued. You might be lucky on M2M.

The Fifty Fathoms collection embodies Blancpain’s passion for the marine world, introduced for the first time in 1953 with the creation of the first modern diver’s watch. Ever since, we have worked alongside divers, scientists and underwater photographers in their exploration and discovery of the awe-inspiring beauty of the oceans, contributing in this way to the revelations of this fascinating world and the motivation to protect it.

All the Fifty Fathoms models bear the principal distinctive characteristics that forged the reputation of their legendary ancestor and established it as the archetypal diver’s watch. The same professionalism can be seen in the decisive choices, dictated by long experience of diving, its risks and its essential needs.
